# This is the ssh client system-wide configuration file.
# See sshd_config(5) for more information on any settings used. Comments will be added only to clarify why a configuration was chosen.

# Basic configuration
# ===================

# Either disable or only allow root login via certificates.
PermitRootLogin {{ ssh_permit_root_login }}

# Define which port sshd should listen to. Default to `22`.
Port {{ ssh_server_port }}

# Address family should always be limited to the active network configuration.
AddressFamily {{ addressfamily }}

# Define which addresses sshd should listen to. Default to `0.0.0.0`, ie make sure you put your desired address in here, since otherwise sshd will listen to everyone.
{% for address in ssh_listen_to %}
ListenAddress {{ address }}
{% endfor %}

# Security configuration
# ======================

# Set the protocol version to 2 for security reasons. Disables legacy support.
Protocol 2

# Make sure sshd checks file modes and ownership before accepting logins. This prevents accidental misconfiguration.
StrictModes {{ sshd_strict_modes }}

# Logging, obsoletes QuietMode and FascistLogging
SyslogFacility {{ sshd_syslog_facility }}
LogLevel {{ sshd_log_level }}

# Authentication
# --------------

# Secure Login directives.

# Enable public key authentication
PubkeyAuthentication yes

# Never use host-based authentication. It can be exploited.
IgnoreRhosts yes
IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes
HostbasedAuthentication no

# Enable PAM to enforce system wide rules
UsePAM yes

# Set AuthenticationMethods per default to publickey
# AuthenticationMethods was introduced in OpenSSH 6.2 - https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-6.2
AuthenticationMethods {{ sshd_authenticationmethods }}

# Disable password-based authentication, it can allow for potentially easier brute-force attacks.
PasswordAuthentication {{ ssh_server_password_login }}
PermitEmptyPasswords no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication {{ ssh_challengeresponseauthentication }}

# Only enable Kerberos authentication if it is configured.
#KerberosAuthentication no
#KerberosOrLocalPasswd no
#KerberosTicketCleanup yes
#KerberosGetAFSToken no

# Only enable GSSAPI authentication if it is configured.
#GSSAPIAuthentication no
#GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes

# In case you don't use PAM (`UsePAM no`), you can alternatively restrict users and groups here. For key-based authentication this is not necessary, since all keys must be explicitely enabled.

# Network
# -------

# Disable TCP keep alive since it is spoofable. Use ClientAlive messages instead, they use the encrypted channel
TCPKeepAlive no

# Manage `ClientAlive..` signals via interval and maximum count. This will periodically check up to a `..CountMax` number of times within `..Interval` timeframe, and abort the connection once these fail.
ClientAliveInterval {{ ssh_client_alive_interval }}
ClientAliveCountMax {{ ssh_client_alive_count }}

# Disable tunneling
PermitTunnel {{ ssh_permit_tunnel }}

# Disable forwarding tcp connections.
# no real advantage without denied shell access
AllowTcpForwarding {{ ssh_allow_tcp_forwarding }}

# Disable agent forwarding, since local agent could be accessed through forwarded connection.
# no real advantage without denied shell access
AllowAgentForwarding {{ ssh_allow_agent_forwarding }}

# Do not allow remote port forwardings to bind to non-loopback addresses.

# Disable X11 forwarding, since local X11 display could be accessed through forwarded connection.
